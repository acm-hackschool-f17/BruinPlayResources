# Resources for BruinPlay

MP3 files are under `audio/` and the corresponding image files are under `cover_art/`. The file `resources.json` contains the links to the MP3 and images where hosted on Github. This file can be placed into the BruinPlay node.js project directory to be used to access music and cover art resources through the links.
